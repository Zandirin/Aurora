## **Planning stage**

### **Target Audiences:**

- Users interested in mental health
- Users interested in finding help for mental issues
- Users interested in mental health organizations who treat female clients
- Women who need help to solve problems they can not solve on their own

### **User Stories:**

- As a user, I want to see the subject matter of the page.
- As a user, I want to navigate the page to find what I require quickly and easily.
- As a user, I want to learn more about what the business offers
- As a user, I want to reach out and contact the business
- As a user, I want the site to be usable on multiple devices

### **Site Aims:**

- To inform the user on services offered by the company
- To inform the user how to reach out and contact professionals
- To offer the user an opportunity to get in contact
- To offer the user a one stop place to find all the information they require to seek helpâ€‹

### **Wireframes:**

Desktop Wireframe:  
![Desktop Wireframe](assets/images/README-images/desktop-wireframe.png)  
Tablet Wireframe:  
![Tablet Wireframe](assets/images/README-images/tablet-wireframe.png)  
Mobile Wireframe:  
![Mobile Wireframe](assets/images/README-images/mobile-wireframe.png)

### **Color Scheme:**

For the page we decided on a orange (#A96142) and green theme (#637763) because they are calming colors and also match the company's branding in a complimentary way. Also the colors are slightly darker than the company branding to comply with WCAG contrast rules and make the elements of the page stand out better

## **Typography**

The site uses only one font, however, we use several different weights to convey importance of different visual elements.
The font used on the site is Montserrat from google fonts. Montserrat is a nice looking font that is easily readable, therefore making it a perfect choice for this project.
Font is linked in the credits section.

## **Current Features**

## **Future-Enhancements**

- Using the technologies required for this project, I was unable to set up any back end for the contact form. In the future it would be nice to have the contact form build a formatted database to read information from for the company
- I'd also like to add an "accounts" feature to the site where users can sign in/sign up and store information regarding themselves.
- Add an appointment booking system in the accounts section
- Add google maps data to show where the company is located so clients can easily get directions
- Add a live chat for clients to contact the company easily and not have to wait for email communication
- Add more interactive elements to keep users engaged

## **Testing Phase**

### **Accessibility**

Website was tested on the following browsers to ensure accessibility on most devices, tested all possible ways the site could be used and made sure it displayed correctly and was usable on all of the devices:

- Chrome  
![Testing Chrome](assets/images/README-images/32inch.png)  
- Edge  
![Testing Edge](assets/images/README-images/edge.png)  
- Firefox  
![Testing Firefox](assets/images/README-images/firefox.png)  
- Samsung Galaxy A51  
![Testing Phone](assets/images/README-images/mobile.png)  
- Generic tablet device  
![Testing Tablet](assets/images/README-images/tablet.png)  
- Large 32" Monitor  
![Testing Large Screen](assets/images/README-images/32inch.png)  
- Smaller 17" Monitor  
![Testing Small Screen](assets/images/README-images/17inch.png)  

### **Functionality**

Navigation links in navbar were tested to see if links lead to the correct section of the website on click. Test was run on multiple devices, result was almost identical each time. Navbar correctly points user to location of website that is named in the link.

Carousels correctly show each page of information when you click the dots or swipe left/right and stop going left at page one and stop going right at page 3 due to these being the first and last pages on the carousel. This was also tested on multiple devices with identical results each time.

Contact form correctly validates all information has been entered and it is the correct type of information that is entered, tested this by trying to put something other than an email address in the email input, form will not submit until it is correctly given an email address.

Contact form opens up user's default email client with a prefilled email and target to send the email to. Tested again on multiple browsers to ensure the experience is successful and the same on all devices.

All external links tested, again on multiple browsers to ensure that once clicked they open the clicked link in a new tab so the user doesn't lose the page they came from and can quickly and easily navigate their way back to the original site.

### **HTML & CSS Validators**

- The site was run through a few validators to make sure it complies with accessibility guidelines.
- Accessibility web helper shows up with 0 errors.  
  ![Accessibility Web Helper Screenshot](assets/images/README-images/accessibility-web-helper.png)
- Lighthouse chrome extension gives high scores for performance & SEO and a perfect score for accessibility.  
  ![Lighthouse Extension Screenshot](assets/images/README-images/lighthouse.png)
- w3 CSS validator finds no errors in the CSS.  
  ![w3 CSS Validator Screenshot](assets/images/README-images/w3-css-check.png)
- w3 HTML validator shows only one error and that is a div that creates the hamburger button on smaller screens.  
  ![w3 HTML Validator Screenshot](assets/images/README-images/w3-html-check.png)

## **Bugs**

- Issue - The carousel in the about us section sometimes drops down and behind the next part of the section
- Cause - Unknown. This is not in my code but in the code provided by Flickity.
- Resolution - Resizing the screen or refreshing the page seems to correct the error. There is no known fix I can perform without the use of more advanced technologies such as javascript, which is out of the scope of this project, sadly.

- Issue - The site had side scroll behaviour that was not intended
- Cause - Navbar was wider than the rest of the page due to hamburger menu div
- Resolution - Forced the navbar to fit in the viewport using a fixed width on the navbar's css selector

## **Deployment**

I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -

1. From the project's [repository](https://github.com/Zandirin/Aurora), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
